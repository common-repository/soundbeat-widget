What is Sound Beat?

Got 90 seconds?

Then you've got time for a trip through the history of recorded sound!  Sound Beat is a 
daily, 90 second show highlighting  the holdings of the Belfer Audio Archive.  The Belfer 
is part of the Syracuse University Library, and with over half a million recordings, is 
one of the largest sound archives in the United States. Each SB episode focuses on one 
particular recording from the Archive, and provides a back story detailing its place in 
recording history.

What kinds of recordings? Popular and classical music performances, film scores those from
distinctly American musical forms like jazz, bebop, country, and bluegrass. Old 
favorites, rare gems, and some we guarantee you've never heard before… from Cab Calloway 
to the castrated stars of Italian opera, you'll hear it all on the Sound Beat!

And it's not just music. Sound Beat episodes also feature speeches and spoken word 
performances from some of the great thinkers, political figures and luminaries from the 
late 19th and early- to mid-20th centuries. People like Thomas Edison, George Bernard  
Shaw, Amelia Earhart, Albert Einstein, and Theodore Roosevelt.
